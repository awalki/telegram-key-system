- SQLiteStudio (optional, but it's more comfortable)

```
git clone https://github.com/awalking/telegram-key-system.git
```
## Provide your BOT_TOKEN to .env<br/>You can get it here - https://t.me/BotFather
```
BOT_TOKEN = YOUR BOT_TOKEN
```
## Run run_win.bat to activate key system.
> First you need to generate keys, after run telegram bot
